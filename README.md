# personalized-medicine

In fall quarter of my senior year of college, I did a project focusing on DeepAEG, a model for predicting cancer drug response based on individualized patient records ([link to ncbi article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10925015/)). This project opened my eyes to the world of personalized medicine and its importance, especially with the rapid rise of machine learning/AI making these tools easier to use.

Cancer is especially important to focus our personalized medicine efforts on as cancer is not just one disease - it is a myriad of diseases that have different effects, levels of *** etc. 

In this project, I hope to gain a better understanding of how personalized medicine algorithms work and try to create my own algorithm that predicts the effect of genetic variants in order to enhance personalized medicine. I'm using a Kaggle dataset from 2017 that was a part of a competition that has long since finished. I will be using Python as my primary language.

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy my analysis!
